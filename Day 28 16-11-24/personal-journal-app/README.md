# Personal Journal App - Backend Documentation

This document provides an overview of the backend architecture and setup for the Personal Journal App, which is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This section focuses on the backend components.

## Backend Overview

The backend of the Personal Journal App is responsible for handling data storage, retrieval, and management. It provides a RESTful API for the frontend to interact with, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete journal entries.

### Key Technologies

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to build the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to create the API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store journal entries and user data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to define schemas and interact with the database.

### API Endpoints

- **POST /api/journals**: Create a new journal entry.
- **GET /api/journals**: Retrieve all journal entries.
- **GET /api/journals/:id**: Retrieve a specific journal entry by its ID.
- **PUT /api/journals/:id**: Update a journal entry by its ID.
- **DELETE /api/journals/:id**: Delete a journal entry by its ID.

### Running the Backend

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `backend` directory and run `npm install` to install the required packages.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the necessary environment variables, such as `MONGO_URI` for the MongoDB connection string and `PORT` for the server port.

3. **Start the Server**: Run `npm start` to start the Express server. The server will connect to the MongoDB database and listen for incoming requests on the specified port.

## Deployment

To deploy the backend, you can use services like Heroku. Ensure that environment variables are correctly set in the deployment environment.
