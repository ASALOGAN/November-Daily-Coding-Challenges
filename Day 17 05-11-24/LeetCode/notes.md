### **Notes on Problem 1: Contains Duplicate**

# Intuition

The problem requires checking if there are any duplicate values in an array. The simplest way to think about this is to use a data structure that can efficiently check for the existence of an element, such as a Set, which inherently does not allow duplicates.

# Approach

The approach involves iterating through the array and adding each element to a Set. If an element is already present in the Set, it means we have found a duplicate, and we can immediately return `true`. If we finish iterating through the array without finding any duplicates, we return `false`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:
  The time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are iterating through the array once, and each operation of adding to or checking the Set is on average $$O(1)$$.

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity is $$O(n)$$, as in the worst case, all elements are unique and we store all of them in the Set.
