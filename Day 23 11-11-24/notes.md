**Day 23 Notes for Problem: Finding the Middle Node of a Linked List**

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the middle node of a linked list. My first thought was to use two pointers to traverse the list at different speeds. This way, when the faster pointer reaches the end of the list, the slower pointer will be at the middle.

# Approach
The approach involves using the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, which is a two-pointer technique. We initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting at the head of the linked list. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. When the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle node. This method efficiently finds the middle node in a single pass through the list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: 
  The time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the list once with the two pointers.

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity is $$O(1)$$ because we only use a constant amount of extra space for the two pointers.
