# **Notes for Problem: Remove Nth Node From End of List**

# Intuition
The problem requires removing the nth node from the end of a linked list. A straightforward approach is to first determine the length of the list, then calculate the position of the node to be removed from the start. However, this can be optimized by using two pointers to traverse the list in a single pass.

# Approach
We use a two-pointer technique with a dummy node to simplify edge cases, such as removing the head. The first pointer is moved n+1 steps ahead to maintain a gap of n nodes between the first and second pointers. Then, both pointers are moved together until the first pointer reaches the end. At this point, the second pointer will be just before the node to be removed. We then adjust the pointers to skip the desired node.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
The time complexity is $$O(L)$$, where L is the length of the linked list, as we traverse the list with the two pointers.

- Space complexity:
The space complexity is $$O(1)$$, as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
