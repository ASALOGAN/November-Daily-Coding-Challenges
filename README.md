# November-Daily-Coding-Challenges
Daily coding challenges for November 2024. This repository contains solutions to coding challenges solved each day to improve problem-solving skills and consistency. Challenges are sourced from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, covering topics such as algorithms, data structures, and system design.

Welcome to the **November Daily Coding Challenges** repository! This repository contains my solutions to daily coding challenges for the month of November 2024. The goal of this project is to improve problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and consistency by committing solutions to GitHub every day.

## Overview

- **Start Date:** November 1, 2024
- **End Date:** November 30, 2024
- **Platforms Used:** LeetCode, HackerRank
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, etc.)
  - Data Structures (Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Recursion & Backtracking
  - System Design & Optimization

## Daily Structure

Each day, I will:
1. Solve one or more coding challenges (easy to medium difficulty).
2. Commit the solution(s) to this repository.
3. Include comments explaining the approach and thought process behind the solution.

## Directory Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
```
