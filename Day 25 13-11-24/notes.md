**Day 25 Notes for Problem: Valid Anagram**

# Intuition
The problem requires determining if two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. My initial thought was to count the frequency of each character in both strings and compare these frequencies.

# Approach
The approach involves using a frequency counter. We iterate over the first string and count the occurrences of each character. Then, we iterate over the second string and decrement the count for each character. If any character count goes below zero or a character is not found, the strings are not anagrams. If all counts are zero at the end, the strings are anagrams.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  The time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the strings. This is because we iterate through each string once.

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity is $$O(1)$$ because the frequency counter uses a constant amount of extra space, limited by the number of unique characters (26 lowercase English letters).
