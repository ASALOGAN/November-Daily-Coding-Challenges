### **Notes on Problem 1: Add Two Numbers**

# Intuition
The problem requires adding two numbers represented by linked lists, where each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order. The key insight is to simulate the addition process as we do manually, digit by digit, while keeping track of any carry that results from the sum of two digits.

# Approach
1. Initialize a dummy head node to simplify edge cases and a current pointer to build the result list.
2. Use a carry variable to handle sums greater than 9.
3. Traverse both linked lists simultaneously, adding corresponding digits along with the carry.
4. If one list is shorter, continue with the remaining digits of the longer list.
5. After processing both lists, if there's a carry left, add a new node with its value.
6. Return the next node of the dummy head, which is the start of the result list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: 
  - $$O(\max(m, n))$$, where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of the two linked lists. We traverse both lists once.
- Space complexity:
  - $$O(\max(m, n))$$, for the space used by the new linked list to store the result.
