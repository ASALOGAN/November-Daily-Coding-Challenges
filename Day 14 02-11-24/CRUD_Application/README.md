## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, read, update, and delete tasks with ease.
- **Filtering**: Filter tasks based on status, priority, or tags to quickly find what you need.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes to tasks are reflected in real-time, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Secure API**: The backend API is secured with proper validation and error handling to ensure data integrity.
- **Environment Configuration**: Easily configure the application using environment variables for different deployment environments.

## Backend Overview

The backend of this TODO List application is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database. It provides a RESTful API for managing tasks, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.

### Key Components

- **Express Server**: The server is set up using Express, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate handlers.

- **MongoDB and Mongoose**: MongoDB is used as the database to store task data. Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a schema-based solution to model application data.

- **Environment Configuration**: The application uses the `dotenv` package to manage environment variables, such as database connection strings and server port numbers.

### Backend Structure

- **Config**: Contains configuration files, such as `db.js`, which manages the connection to the MongoDB database.

- **Controllers**: Contains logic for handling API requests. The `taskController.js` file includes functions to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks.

- **Models**: Contains Mongoose schemas that define the structure of the data. The `Task.js` file defines the schema for a task, including fields like name, status, due date, priority, and tags.

- **Routes**: Defines API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks. The `taskRoutes.js` file maps HTTP methods and paths to controller functions.

### API Endpoints

- **POST /api/tasks**: Create a new task.
- **GET /api/tasks**: Retrieve all tasks, with optional filtering by status, priority, or tags.
- **PUT /api/tasks/:id**: Update a task by its ID.
- **DELETE /api/tasks/:id**: Delete a task by its ID.

### Running the Backend

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `backend` directory and run `npm install` to install the required packages.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the necessary environment variables, such as `MONGO_URI` for the MongoDB connection string and `PORT` for the server port.

3. **Start the Server**: Run `npm start` to start the Express server. The server will connect to the MongoDB database and listen for incoming requests on the specified port.

## Frontend Overview

The frontend of the TODO List application is built using React, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend API. The frontend allows users to add, view, filter, edit, and delete tasks with ease.

### Key Components

- **React**: A JavaScript library used to build the user interface for the application, ensuring a smooth, interactive experience.
- **Axios**: This HTTP client is used to make requests to the backend API, handling CRUD operations for tasks.
- **Component-based Architecture**: The application is divided into reusable components such as TaskList, TaskForm, and TaskFilter.

### Frontend Structure

- **Public**: Contains static assets like `index.html`, which is the main entry HTML file, and `favicon.ico`.
- **Components**: Includes UI components that handle specific functionalities, such as displaying a list of tasks (TaskList), adding or editing tasks (TaskForm), and filtering tasks (TaskFilter).
- **Pages**: Contains page-level components, like the main Home.js file, which serves as the main view displaying the task list.
- **Service**: Contains files for interacting with the backend API. For example, `task.js` defines methods to make API calls for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
- **App.js**: Main component that serves as the root of the application, managing routing and wrapping all other components.
- **index.js**: Entry point for the React application, rendering the App component into the DOM.

### Running the Frontend

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `npm install` to install required packages.
2. **Start the Application**: Run `npm start` to start the React application. It will open in the browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you can use services like Heroku for the backend and Vercel or Netlify for the frontend. Ensure that environment variables are correctly set in the deployment environment.
